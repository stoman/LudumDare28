# LudumDare28

This is my submission for the 28th edition of the 48h game creation contest. Please also find the game's entry at [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=21963). I'm looking forward to read your comments there.

You can find the game itself at [my website](http://games.stoman.de/ludumdare28/).

## Game Description

This is my second time taking part in a Ludum Dare. This great contest made my finish my second and fourth game :) Obviously, these games are quite small and only have a few levels and so on (I guess you know what I mean), but I hope you will like it nevertheless. 

In this game you have to open locks with the corresponding keys hidden in the dungeons. There are several locks in most levels, but you only get one key. Therefore, you will need several tries for most levels, but you will see. 

I'm looking forward to reading your comments on whether you like the game or not. In either case I would appreciate if you could tell me what can or should be done better the next time. Thanks for playing, rating and commenting. 

Controls: 
- mouse for selecting levels 
- arrow keys for moving 
- escape to leave a level 

Remember, you only get one key ;)
