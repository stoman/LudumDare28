					This game was created during 48 hours for Ludum Dare 28. Please find all information on the game and the contest as well as a form for commenting at <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=21963">the Ludum Dare website</a>. The contest's theme was &quot;You Only Get One&quot;.

					This is my second time taking part in a Ludum Dare. This great contest made my finish my econd and fourth game :) Obviously, these games are quite small and only have a few levels and so on (I guess you know), but I hope you will like it nevertheless.

					In this game you have to open locks with the corresponding keys hidden in the dungeons. There are several locks in most level, but you only get one key. Therefore, you will need several tries for most levels, but you will see.

					I'm looking forward to read your comments on whether you like the game. In either case I would appreciate if you cold tell me what can or should be done better the next time. Thanks for playing, rating and commenting.

					Remember, you only get one key ;)
